Statusfy
========

Spotify in your status bar.
This is a fork of [Paul Young's Statusfy](https://github.com/paulyoung/Statusfy) extended with the following features:
* Hide the whole thing when no music's playing
* Save state of your settings between launches
* Added a nice note â™ª next to the song's artist :)
